compound interest calculator

This is Sahil Das's work.

I made this as a project for my codeyoung python teacher.

I took some notes on this since I dunno what compound interest was. The notes are in this <a href="https://github.com/suhasdas/compound-interest-calculator/blob/main/Notes.md">link</a>.
